- **Open source**: All code is transparent and auditable

## Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Registration Failed (Status Code: 15)
This usually indicates missing permissions or syntax errors:
1. **Check icon files**: Ensure `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, and `icon128.png` exist
2. **Verify manifest.json**: Make sure all syntax is correct
3. **Check file permissions**: Ensure all files are readable
4. **Reload extension**: Go to chrome://extensions/ and click the reload button
5. **Check console**: Look for specific error messages in the extension's service worker

### "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'onClicked')"
This error occurs when Chrome APIs aren't available:
1. **Update Chrome**: Ensure you're using Chrome 88+ for Manifest V3 support
2. **Check permissions**: Verify all required permissions are in manifest.json
3. **Reload extension**: Sometimes a simple reload fixes API availability issues

### Extension Not Working
1. Ensure all files are in the correct folder
2. Check that Developer Mode is enabled
3. Reload the extension from chrome://extensions/
4. Refresh the webpage you're trying to scan
5. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Cannot Scan Certain Pages
The extension cannot scan:
- Chrome internal pages (chrome://)
- Extension pages (chrome-extension://)
- Local file:// URLs
- Some protected pages
- Pages with strict Content Security Policy

### No Results Showing
1. Wait for the scan to complete (usually 2-5 seconds)
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Try manually clicking "Scan Page"
4. Reload the page and try again
5. Ensure the page is not blocked by CSP or other security measures

### Icons Not Displaying
1. **Create icon files**: Use `create_icons.html` for instructions
2. **Check file names**: Must be exactly `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
3. **Verify file format**: Must be PNG format
4. **Check file location**: Icons must be in the same folder as manifest.json
